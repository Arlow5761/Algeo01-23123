   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arlow5761/Algeo01-23123.git
   ```

   Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Compile and run the application**:

   - **For Windows users**:

     - Build the project by running:

       ```bash
       windows_build.bat
       ```

     - Run the project using:

       ```bash
